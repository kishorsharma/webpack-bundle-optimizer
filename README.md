## Documentation

Optimisation is one place which make many web developers to bang their head on wall. As mobile user
are increasing, initial load time plays also a major factor in you web-app performance.

One of JavaScriptâ€™s heaviest costs is the time for a JS engine to parse/compile/optimize JS code. There is very good article provides insight of JS execution and parsing cost: [The cost of JavaScript in 2019](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019).

Modern JS engine V8 (others) do a pre-parse most functions before doing a full parse. This step checks for syntax errors. This saves cost of full parse if there exist any error. However, there are use cases (like webpack output bundle) where we want to execute our JS code as soon as possible.
In cases (which include common module formats like UMD/Browserify/Webpack/etc.), the browser will actually parse the function twice, first as a pre-parse and second as a full parse.
